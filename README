At this point, I have learned Java through 
    YouTube, StackOverflow, and a Community College Course.

In an attempt to cover the holes in my knowledge,
    I have decided to relearn java through
    Deitel's 10th Edition of "Java: How to Program."

Each program in this git will reflect my answers to the text's
    exercises.

By the end of the book, I hope to have sufficient knowledge
    in Java to be able to build > 50% of what is requested of me.
