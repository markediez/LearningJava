Going through this chapter, I learned about UML diagrams.
I would give it a go, but I'm not sure which program to get.
I also realized what the keyword "new" does (asks for memory from the system
        for my object)

I now know how other reference type like String can be used b/c
    the java.lang library is automatically imported

Finally, I now know that instance variables are already intialized to
    0 / false / or null.
