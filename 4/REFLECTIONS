Through this chapter I now understand the use of Graphics,
    I've used it before going through YouTube tutorials on 
    creating Java 2D platformer games but this soldifies such knowledge.
    It is used to draw text and shapes on the screen.

I also learned that each JPanel calls on paintComponent which is why
    it can draw stuff. It is so cool to understand things that use to
    be in the "black box."
