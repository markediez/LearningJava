PUBLIC-KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY
    - refers to a set of cryptographic algorithms that are based on
        mathematical problems that admit to no efficient solution

    - public-key(asymmetric key) encryption makes use of public and
        private key for encryption
            - private key only known to personal computer
            - public key is used to communicate, it is being sent

    - key pair is based on prime numbers of long length

    - Encryption steps:
        o sending comp encrypts w/ symmetric key
        o encrypt symmetric key w/ receiving comp public key
        o receiving comp use own private key to decrypt symmetric key
        o use symmetric key to decode the doc

PGP (Pretty Good Privacy)
    - public encryption program
    - scheme uses hybrid cryptosystem
        o compress plain data
        o create session key (one time only secret key)
            ~ random number based on random mouse movement and keystrokes
        o encrypt data with the session key
        o encrypt session key with receipient's public key
        o receipient recovers session key with his/her private key
        o pgp uses session key to decrypt the cipher text

RSA Scheme
    - both public and private key can be used to encrypt a message
        the latter is used to decrypt it
    - creates its key by multiplying two large prime numbers
        o generated by Rabin-Miller's primality test algorithm
    - modulus n made by multiplying the primary numbers
        o this is the link between private and public key
    - public key
        o generated by the modulus n and the exponent e, normally, 65537
    - private key
        o generated by the modulus n and the private exponent d
            ~ d is found using Extended Euclidean algorithm
                to find the multiplicative inverse of the totient of n
