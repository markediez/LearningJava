5.5 
4 basic elements of counter-controlled repetition
- counter variable
- number of times to loop predefined
- increment at the end of the loop
- condition of the loop

5.6
while
	o can increment as needed
	o must initialize prior to the loop
	o more effective as a sentinel-controlled repetition
for
	o initialization, condition, and increment in one line
	o increments automatically at the end of the loop
	o more effective as a counter-controlled repetition
both
	o loops the code while the condition is true

5.7
prompting for information such as entering x grades. By doing a do-while loop,
	I won't have to repeat the code prior to a while / for loop and within the loop.

5.8
break - breaks away from the control statement (loops / switch)
continue - proceeds the the next iteration of a loop statement

5.9
a. should be "for", not "For"
b. at least case 0: needs a break; after the prior to introducing case 1
c. the for loop increment should be -= not +=
d. the while condition should either be <= 100, or < 102 . Not < 100.
	Also, it should be "while" not "While"

5.10
prints "@@@@@" ten times (new line after the 5th '@')
