This chapter was really tedious. However, I did understand the difference between
	the boolean conditional operators and regular conditional operators.
	boolean conditional operators do not use short-circuit evaluations
	so it ALWAYS checks both condition before proceeding.

I really enjoy Deitel's "Making a Difference" section. It brings awareness to
	current events. Also, it illustrates how programming can be used as a 
	compliment to the world today.
