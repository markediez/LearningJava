Divide and Conquer with Classes and Methods
	- divide and conquer approach
		o build a program with small, simple pieces
	- software reusability
		o use existing classes and mehtods to create new programs

static
	- methods and variables in a class that can be used without creating
		an instance of the class e.g. Math.abs(-3) and Math.PI can be used without
		first indicating Math m = new Math();
		<ClassName>.<staticMethod>(arguments);
		<ClassName>.<staticVar>

	- When using a static var, you share a the var from the class;
		you are not creating your own copy in the program

final
	- makes variables constant

why have public static void main(String[] args) ?
	- java <ClassName> argument1 argument2 ...
	- then you can access the "array" for the arguments

methods
	- public - seen by all
	- static - can be called by all
			 - also, required if another static class (e.g. main)
			 		is calling the method b/c it would not make
			 		sense for a non-static method to be used
			 		when another class attempts to use the
			 		static method
	- methodName(parameters)
		o can have more than 1 parameter, 
		o each parameter must have a var type,
		o when called(used), arguments must be consistent with the parameters.

		e.g. to use public static int max(double a, String n, boolean b) { ... }
		the class calling it must say max(someDouble, someString, someBoolean)
						it cannot be  max(someString, someDouble, someBoolean)
