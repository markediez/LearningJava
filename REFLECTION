In this chapter I learned:
	o the use of args[] when declaring main. 
	o SecureRandom for extra security in randomly generating numbers
	o life cycle of a method and the existence of 
		a method-call stack with a stackframe which is only possible
		through the stack data structure
	o GUI-wise, creating filled shapes

So far, I have learned something new in every chapter. I am not regretting
	this.
